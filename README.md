# GIT-FUND  

##  Description  
**Git-Fund** is a decentralized platform that connects recruiters with freelancers via GitHub. It enables recruiters to post bounties, link them to GitHub issues, and process payments through smart contracts automatically when the PR (pull request) is accepted.

### How It Works  
1. **Post a Bounty:**  
   - Recruiters provide task details.  
   - Optionally, attach a GitHub issue from a selected repository.  
   - Payments are made in cryptocurrency via MetaMask to a smart contract.  

2. **Freelancer Contributions:**  
   - Freelancers submit pull requests to complete the bounty.  

3. **Approval & Payment:**  
   - Recruiters can review pull requests under the **"My Repo"** tab.  
   - Once accepted, the smart contract automatically transfers funds to the freelancer.
