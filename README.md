# GIT-FUND

## Description
The app connects to user's GitHub then, if the user wishes to recruit freelancers he can post a bounty in which he will provide details about the bounty (Freelance work) and then choose an issue on GitHub repo selected (optional) then the recruiter connects his metamask and pays in derired currency to smart contract address.
<br>
After posting the bounty, recruiter can check my-repo tab and see pull requests to either accept or reject them, as soon as the pull request is accepted. The money (in form of crypto) will be transferred to freelancer's account.
